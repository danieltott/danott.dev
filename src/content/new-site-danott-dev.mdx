It's been [10 years since I've redesigned my site](/thoughts/new-site-design-2013-07-15), so I thought it was about time for a new one.

I'm also saying goodbye to [dtott.com](https://dtott.com), and hello to [danott.dev](https://danott.dev)!

## danott.dev

I've had the dtott.com domain for a really long time and it's served me well. But, I stopped referring to myself as "Daniel T Ott" in most scenarios a while ago, so it was always sort of hard to explain the "t" in "dtott."

danott.dev is a lot easier to remember and to say out loud, and I'm also a big fan of the .dev TLD, so I'm happy to have a domain with that extension.

## New Design

I've been working on this new design for a while now, and I'm really happy with how it turned out.

### Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, and MDX

- I based the design and initial structure off of [Tailwind UI Spotlight template](https://tailwindui.com/templates/spotlight), but obviously made some major changes to it.

  For one thing, Spotlight is built using Next.js's Page Router, but I very much wanted to use the App Router ([naturally](/thoughts/nextjs-app-router-talk)). Spotlight is also written in Javascript, and I'm much more comfortable in Typescript these days, so I rewrote the whole thing in Typescript.

- The [content is stored in MDX](https://github.com/danieltott/danott.dev/tree/main/src/content), and [imported in to Next.js pages](<https://github.com/danieltott/danott.dev/blob/a625721a2b70911ab5e7d60f0e291ba74a52eb12/src/app/(site)/thoughts/%5Bslug%5D/page.tsx#L46-L52>) via React Server Components. I was able to pretty easily import my old content to the new platform, so that was good.

### Design Elements

- The design of the site is inspired by one of my all-time favorite children's books, [The Monster at the End of the Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monster_at_the_End_of_This_Book:_Starring_Lovable,_Furry_Old_Grover), written by Jon Stone and illustrated by Michael Smollin.

- The title font is a special pre-relase version of a font called <span className="font-freeLunch font-normal not-italic">Free Lunch</span> by [Dan Cederholm of SimpleBits](https://simplebits.shop/).

- The stars are generated using [`konva-react` with random styles applied to them](https://github.com/danieltott/danott.dev/blob/main/src/components/StarKonva.tsx), positioned via [Bezier JS](https://pomax.github.io/bezierjs/). I went through several iterations of this - starting with outputting a ton of SVGs, then using `<canvas>` by hand, then finally using `konva-react` to generate the canvas elements. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.

- Social Images are generated using [Next.js's <code>ImageResponse</code>](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/opengraph-image#generate-images-using-code-js-ts-tsx)
  <Image src={openGraphImage} alt="dtott.dev social image" />
